Categorize the movie genre by movie name using NLP

We have designed an interactive and innovative graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to input a movie name. The system then processes this input by analyzing and calculating the result through backend algorithms. Additionally, we have integrated a chatbot that utilizes a rule-based method to enhance user interaction and provide more dynamic responses. This combination of an intuitive interface and intelligent backend processing ensures a seamless and engaging experience for users.
